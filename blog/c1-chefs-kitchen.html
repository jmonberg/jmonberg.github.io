  <h1>My Take on DBC Culture</h1>

  <h4>April 12, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      I am exremely excited about the DBC culture, from everything I've seen in DBC materials, from things I've seen online, and from the DBC alum I've talked to.  There are a vast array of resources online that can provide the technical skills needed to code.  It is much rarer to have an immersive opportunity to develop world class development, communication, and leadership skills.  I can't wait for the opportunity.
    <p>
        Over the past eight years, I've taught courses on user experience, digital rhetoric, and media mobility at Michigan State University.  I've worked closely with students, community members, technical staff, and local companies to develop three software projects designed to give the Greater Lansing community a voice in shaping their future.

    <p>
        I'm passionate about creating a "kitchen" culture with these projects.  I worked to create a shared vision, a variety of roles that allowed individuals cultivate their specialized talents, and a cooperative development process.  When this works well, magic can happen, and we created some amazing resources.  Competition kills people's ability to be open, experiment, and motivate themselves.
    </p>
 <p>
        I'm looking forward to working with a cohort of smart, creative, passionate people.  I want to develop my own skills of openness, vulnerability, frequently sharing my coding thinking, and accomplishing bite sized chunks of work.
