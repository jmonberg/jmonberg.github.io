      Software development can involve many people changing many things. Version control allows you to maintain a current set of changes, create branches for new changes, and back out changes if problems occur.

        When you move beyond the most basic coding toy problems, it becomes crucial to manage the process of coordination and change. Git provides a common set of approaches and tools to make this process consistent and accountable.

        Github is the most commonly used repository, so it is easy to find techniques to make version control more effective.  As long as your code is public, Github is free to use, which is an important benefit.
